# WordPress: Civic Tech Toronto

This is a WordPress repository configured to run on the **Civic Tech
Toronto** website on the [Pantheon platform](https://pantheon.io).

**Pantheon** is website platform optimized and configured to run high performance sites with an amazing developer workflow. There is built-in support for features such as Varnish, Redis, Apache Solr, New Relic, Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, PhantomJS and more.Â 

## About

Our experimental development site is hosted at:
https://dev-civictechto.pantheonsite.io

The Pantheon dashboard is here:
https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/2719de9e-f8ef-44d0-9627-bc83e50bd0e2

You'll need to ask for access to the dashboard. (Check our [Service
Access doc][service-access] to see who can give it to you.)

## Philosophy

- Keep important site configuration in code, not in the database.
- Capture plugin and theme customizations in version control, as opposed
  to untracked changes on an FTP server.

## File Organization

- Theme customizations are stored in
  [`web/wp-content/themes/custom/zerif-lite-child`][child-theme]
- We are using a custom version of the [Meetup Widgets
  plugin][meetup-widget]. (See [changes][meetup-plugin-changes])
- All other themes and plugins are using unmodified versions.
- We use [Composer package manager][about-composer] to help manage Wordpress.
  - `composer.json` specifies roughly what theme/plugin version we want
  - `composer.lock` locks these themes/plugins to specific versions
  - `composer` commands help us rebuild the theme/plugin directories
    according to what we want

## Projects page

The [Projects page][projects-page] is a little special. It is
automatically generated and updated from the ["Hacknight Projects"
Trello board][projects-board], using projects specifically tagged with
the `Website Featured` label.
